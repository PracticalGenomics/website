RStudio provides a [rich environment](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/features/) to work with R including a syntax-highlighting editor, integrated help and documentation, and interactive [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming) through [R Notebooks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/r_notebooks.html).

We make extensive use of [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) documents for preparation assignments, workshop sessions, and preparing reproducible reports.
