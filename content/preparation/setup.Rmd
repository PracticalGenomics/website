## Did you?

1. Email your TA the `k4.png` file after `conda install` 5 programs
1. Email your TA an IGV screenshot for `HUES64_rep1.mRNA.chr20.bw`
1. Check your 12 R packages are installed e.g. `library( "annotatr" )`

## Do each morning by 9:00am ...

1. **Help** -- Monitor `#questions` from your Slack.app (laptop and phone)
1. **Unix** -- Load programs installed via conda on MARCC
    ```
    ssh gateway2.marcc.jhu.edu -l username@jhu.edu
    srun -p shared -c 1 --mem 1024 -t 120 --pty bash
    module load anaconda-python/3.6
    source activate pg2018
    deeptools
    ```
1. **Transfer** -- Practice copying a file from MARCC
    - Scroll to see entire command ... ends in `Desktop/PG2018/...`
    ```
    scp username@jhu.edu@gateway2.marcc.jhu.edu:work/test.txt Desktop/PG2018/monday.txt
    ```
    - Check that file exists on your laptop by opening it
1. **IGV** -- Start genomic visualization tool
    - Test by loading `HUES64_rep1.mRNA.chr20.bw` and zooming into `DNMT3B` gene
1. **RStudio** -- Start integrated development environment for R
    - Test by `library( "annotatr" )`
1. **Notes** -- Store commands using TextEdit.app or Wordpad
    - Be sure to disable auto-correct features
        - e.g. Uncheck in TextEdit > Preferences
            - Correct spelling automatically
            - Smart quotes
            - Smart dashes
