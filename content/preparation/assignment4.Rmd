## Learning Objectives

1. Continue practicing Unix on MARCC
    - Install programs with conda
    - Create a metagene with deepTools
1. Practice transfering files from MARCC
1. Install IGV
1. Continue practicing plotting using R


## Tasks

1. Install programs using conda and test [deepTools](https://deeptools.readthedocs.io/)
    - Connect to MARCC [via ssh](https://practicalgenomics.github.io/marcc/)
    - Follow these [instructions](https://github.com/PracticalGenomics/assignments/blob/master/conda.Rmd)
    - Log out of MARCC (or use a different terminal).  Transfer metagene plot from MARCC to local computer to view image (scroll right to see entire command ... ends in `Desktop/PG2018`)

    ```
    scp username@jhu.edu@gateway2.marcc.jhu.edu:scratch/prepwork/k4.png Desktop/PG2018
    ```

1. Install IGV
    - Install the [IGV 2.4.10](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download) Mac App or Windows Zip (not Launch icon)
        - Install [Java](https://www.java.com/download) v1.8 if not already installed (not 1.7 or 1.9)
    - Transfer [bigWig](https://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/help/bigWig.html) file using scp (scroll to see entire command)
    
    ```
    scp username@jhu.edu@gateway2.marcc.jhu.edu:work/roadmap/HUES64_rep1.mRNA.chr20.bw Desktop/PG2018
    ```
    
    - Start IGV
        - Select "Human [hg19](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/grc/human)" in the upper left
        - In the File menu, select "Load from File" and select the `HUES64_rep1.mRNA.chr20.bw` file in Desktop/PG2018
        - Change "All" to "chr20", clicking upper right "+" to zoom
        - Navigate to `chr20:18486382-18543963`
    - Submit screenshot to your TA
1. Plot RNA-seq data in R ( [preview](https://github.com/PracticalGenomics/assignments/blob/master/prepwork-jun.Rmd) )
    - Download assignment ( [`prepwork-jun.Rmd`](https://github.com/PracticalGenomics/assignments/raw/master/prepwork-jun.Rmd) )
    - Save work as `prepwork-jun-lastname.Rmd` and email to your TA
